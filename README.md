### Text from the model

<b>Social Distancing Game</b>
<br><br>
Use the sliders below to find the optimal strategy to minimise infections in this toy universe
of 10,000 people introduced to a single person infected with a novel virus.  
<br><br>
Top slider is social distancing and there are two pairs of sliders for two
government lockdowns. Each pair controls time and duration of deployment.
<br><br>  
Notice that the epidemic is mostly just delayed unless social distancing is strictly adhered to 
and the lockdowns are perfectly placed. Even then, most of the population is still infected.
